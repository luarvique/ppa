# If you have RaspberryPi and no clue ...
Stanislav (LZ2SLL) has built [SD card images for RaspberryPi](https://github.com/luarvique/openwebrx/releases/), containing a clean OpenWebRX+ installation. These images should support all common SDR devices out of the box. The RTL-SDR and SDRPlay devices have been confirmed to work with no additional modifications to the image. Please, keep in mind that __this may not be the latest version__ of OpenWebRX+. Read on for the latest version.

Please note that this SD card image comes without the software support for digital modes (DMR, NXDN, etc), since the software decoder for these modes (mbelib) has questionable origins. **In order to enable digital modes** in this image, ssh into the user account you created while installing the image and type:

    sudo install-softmbe.sh

# If you are using Docker ...
Stanislav (LZ2SLL) has made OpenWebRX+ Docker images that should run on any x64 PC, arm32 SBC, or arm64 SBC. The [base image](https://hub.docker.com/r/slechev/openwebrxplus) and the [softmbe image](https://hub.docker.com/r/slechev/openwebrxplus-softmbe) are based on Debian Bookworm with the latest OpenWebRX+ packages installed. These images should fully support all receivers, features and decoders.

# If you already have OpenWebRX+ installed ...
In order to **upgrade from a previous OpenWebRX+** version, do the following, **as root**:

    apt update
    apt upgrade

# If you are an Ubuntu 22.04 user ...
In order to add this repository to your **Ubuntu 22.04** system, do the following (if asked to type in your password, it is expected - do so):

    curl -s https://luarvique.github.io/ppa/openwebrx-plus.gpg | sudo gpg --yes --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/openwebrx-plus.gpg
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openwebrx-plus.list <<<"deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/openwebrx-plus.gpg] https://luarvique.github.io/ppa/ubuntu ./"
    sudo apt update

You should also have the original OpenWebRX repository added, since it contains some necessary packages. In order to add the original OpenWebRX repository to your **Ubuntu 22.04** system, do the following:

    curl -s https://repo.openwebrx.de/debian/key.gpg.txt | sudo gpg --yes --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/openwebrx.gpg
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openwebrx.list <<<"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/openwebrx.gpg] https://repo.openwebrx.de/ubuntu/ jammy main"
    sudo apt update

# If you are an Ubuntu 24.04 user ...
If you have a **Ubuntu 24.04** system, there is now an experimental OpenWebRX+ build available for you. Do the following (if asked to type in your password, it is expected - do so):

    curl -s https://luarvique.github.io/ppa/openwebrx-plus.gpg | sudo gpg --yes --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/openwebrx-plus.gpg
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openwebrx-plus.list <<<"deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/openwebrx-plus.gpg] https://luarvique.github.io/ppa/noble ./"
    sudo apt update

**Ubuntu 24.04** users **must not** add the original OpenWebRX repository to their system, since it contains Ubuntu 22.04 packages.   

# If you are a Debian Bullseye user ...
In order to add this repository to your **Debian Bullseye** system, do the following (if asked to type in your password, it is expected - do so):

    curl -s https://luarvique.github.io/ppa/openwebrx-plus.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/openwebrx-plus.gpg
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openwebrx-plus.list <<<"deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/openwebrx-plus.gpg] https://luarvique.github.io/ppa/debian ./"
    sudo apt update

You should also have the original OpenWebRX repository added, since it contains some necessary packages. In order to add the original OpenWebRX repository to your **Debian Bullseye** system, do the following:

    curl -s https://repo.openwebrx.de/debian/key.gpg.txt | sudo gpg --yes --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/openwebrx.gpg
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openwebrx.list <<<"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/openwebrx.gpg] https://repo.openwebrx.de/debian/ bullseye main"
    sudo apt update

# If you are a Debian Bookworm user ...
If you have a **Debian Bookworm** system, there is now an experimental OpenWebRX+ build available for you. Do the following (if asked to type in your password, it is expected - do so):

    curl -s https://luarvique.github.io/ppa/openwebrx-plus.gpg | sudo gpg --yes --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/openwebrx-plus.gpg
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openwebrx-plus.list <<<"deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/openwebrx-plus.gpg] https://luarvique.github.io/ppa/bookworm ./"
    sudo apt update

**Debian Bookworm** users **must not** add the original OpenWebRX repository to their system, since it contains Bullseye packages.

# ... and, finally, ...

Finally, in order to install OpenWebRX+, do the following:

    sudo apt install openwebrx

To make sure OpenWebRX+ is running, direct your local web browser to the following address:

    http://localhost:8073/

You should see the OpenWebRX+ web interface, with the noise filter (NR) and tuning step (>-<) controls.

# If you have an SDRPlay device or clone ...

This repository offers the **improved SoapySDRPlay3 device driver** with the following changes from the original version:
* Fixed generic gain control, limiting it to the IFGR setting.
* Made RFGR setting a separate, optional prameter named "rf_gain".
* Fixed frequency correction (ppm) parameter.
* Fixed problems when switching from LIF to wideband ZIF mode.
* Fixed deadlocks when sending settings to the device.
* Added multiple retries when device does not accept a setting.
* Widened filters a little bit, reducing the "hump" size for most bandwidths.
* Added 1.536MHz bandwidth.

In order to install the improved SoapySDRPlay3 package, do the following:

    sudo apt install soapysdr-module-sdrplay3

During installation, the SoapySDRPlay3 package should also install the latest SoapySDR and remove all locally built SoapySDR files from /usr/local. **You will still need to download and install SDRPlay API** from this page:

    https://www.sdrplay.com/downloads/

**SDRPlay API can also be installed as an unofficial package**, by following these instructions:
